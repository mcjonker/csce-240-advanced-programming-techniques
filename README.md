This Repository contains my projects from CSCE-240 Advanced Programming Techniques.

Programs:

- Program 1 intakes a number and its base value, then returns the equivalent value in decimal (base-10).
- Program 2 reads a file with equations: two numbers and an operator each, one equation per line. If the 
operation is possible, the program returns the answer. If the operation is not possible, the user is 
notified with a reason.

Project/Exams:

- Project 1 .. . . .
