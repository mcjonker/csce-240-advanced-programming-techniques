# csce-240-advanced-programming-techniques
This Repository contains my projects from CSCE-240 Advanced Programming Techniques.

Programs:

- Program 1 intakes a number and its base value, then returns the equivalent value in decimal (base-10).
- Program 2 reads a file with equations: two numbers and an operator each, one equation per line. If the 
operation is possible, the program returns the answer. If the operation is not possible, the user is 
notified with a reason.
- Program 3 works with multidimensional arrays. I was provided the frontend of the software, and had to 
develop methods in word_search_functions.cc to fit their parameters defined in the word_search_functions.h 
header file.

Project/Exams:

- Project 1 is a set of three problems. Each problem requires the use of various C++ techniques. I demonstrated knowledge in C++ through this Project.
